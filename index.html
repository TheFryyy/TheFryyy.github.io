            My name is Julien, i'm a student in a french digital engineering school and i'm learning to create video games.
        </p>

        <p class="presentation">
            I began a lot of project but never finished them. I think it's for 3 reasons:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>I began the creation without preparation (like class diagram or script)</li>
            <li>I want to do everything by myself (3D modeling, code ...)</li>
            <li>I have too ambitious projects</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
                But it permited me to learn a lot !
        </p>

        <P>I began learning on Unity in C# and then I changed to Unreal Engine to know which engine fits me the most. </P>

        <p>So know i'm on a project of a south park like which is cool because graphism are simple !</p>

        <p>Now I'll let you surf on my web site to discover what I made or I tried !</p>
