    <p style="padding-left: 50px;"><i>
        My name is Julien, I am a french student in the computer science engineering school Efrei paris.</br>
        I am passionated by video games and I began to learn how to make video games during my free time for 2 years.</br>
        I began with Unity with which I made some mini games and I recently began to learn Unreal Engine.</br> 
        I am currently working on a pretty big project of horror game.</br>

    <p style="padding-left: 50px;"><i>
        Before beginning working on my current project, I realised that all my project were unfinished</br>
        That's why I asked myself: why can't you finish a project ?</br>
        My response was: you never structure your projects before beginning to work on them !</br>
        That's why for Creep, I took a month to define everything I'll have to do.</br>
        I work on it since June 2019 and I think know I will be able to finish it.<!-- </br>
        I had to do a break because I had a lot of work to do for my school but even if it will take time, I'll try to finish it. -->
